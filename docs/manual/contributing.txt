=================

Contributions are highly welcome and much appreciated, so please do not
hesitate!

The various SDKs for the Relyr API are still being actively developped.
You can find the code of the
`Python-SDK on GitHub <https://github.com/relayr/python-sdk/>`_
which is also the place for reporting any bugs and/or patches (preferably
in the form of a pull request). On GitHub you can also find SDKs in other
repositories for other languages/platforms like iOS and Android.

If you have more general questions it is recommended to pose them on the 
`Relayr Forum <https://forum.relayr.io/>`_ where the Relayr team will
respond to them in a timely manner.
