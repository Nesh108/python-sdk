Contributing 
=================

Contributions are highly welcome and much appreciated, so please do not
hesitate! Apart from bug reports we also welcome little self-contained
examples that you might find helpful for others.

The various SDKs for the Relyr API are still being actively developped.
You can find the code of the
`Python-SDK on GitHub <https://github.com/relayr/python-sdk/>`_
which is also the place for reporting any bugs and/or patches (the latter
preferably in the form of a pull request). If you report a bug please
make sure to include information about your OS platform and Python version.

On GitHub you can also find SDKs in other repositories for other languages
or platforms like `iOS and Mac <https://github.com/relayr/apple-sdk/>`_
and `Android <https://github.com/relayr/android-sdk>`_.

If you have more general questions it is recommended to pose them on the 
`Relayr Forum <https://forum.relayr.io/>`_ where the Relayr team will
respond to them in a timely manner.
