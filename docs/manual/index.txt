The Relayr Python API Client
====================================================

This is the documentation of the Python SDK for the Relayr API provided
as a Python package named ``relayr`` (beta). It allows you to connect
to the cloud of Internet of Things applications hosted by
`Relayr.io <http://relayr.io>`_ and interact with applications and devices
provided by yourself or others. 

See the `Relayr API Reference <http://docs.relayr.apiary.io/>`_ for the
ultimate information about the Relayr API itself.
