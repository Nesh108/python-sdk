Documentation 
=============

The official documentation (manual) of the Relayr Python Client is hosted on
ReadTheDocs_. It is also included inside the ``docs/manual`` subdirectory of
the source code distribution. You can render it in various formats using
Sphinx_ called from a little Bash script named ``make_docs.sh`` inside the
root directory of the unarchived source code.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./make_docs.sh

By default this renders only the HTML version in ``docs/manual/_build/html``,
but if you uncomment the respective lines inside you can also render versions
in EPUB and PDF format. For PDF you need to have a working LaTeX installation.
